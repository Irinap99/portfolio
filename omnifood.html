              During my exploration of web design principles, HTML, and CSS, I worked on a project named Omnifood. Through this journey, I honed my skills in crafting intuitive interfaces and implementing responsive layouts, all while delving into the intricacies of HTML and CSS. The Omnifood project served as a hands-on learning experience, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios and refine my abilities in web development.

              <span> Challenges:</span> Implementing the design required meticulous attention to detail to ensure that the vision translated seamlessly from concept to reality. This involved navigating complexities such as layout adjustments, font choices, and color palettes to maintain consistency and enhance usability across different screen sizes. Additionally, optimizing the mobile experience presented its own set of challenges, as I worked to adapt the design and functionality to smaller devices without compromising on user experience.
